We wish to stratify Pharmacist based on their workplace characteristics and sample 10 pharmacist from each group. That means we will have five strata including Community pharmacy, Hospital or other health care facility, Academia or government, Industry, corporate Offices, professional practice or clinic, because we have five different places.

2.	Decide on the sample size for each stratum
Difference between Simple random sampling and stratified random sampling:
Simple random sampling â€“ sometimes known as random selection and stratified random sampling are both statistical measuring tools. Using random selection will minimize bias, as each member of the population is treated equally with an equal likelihood of being sampled. In contrast, stratified random sampling breaks the population into distinct subgroups called strata that have similar attributes.
Disproportionate sampling where the sample size of each stratum is equal irrespective of the population size of the stratum 
3.	Randomly sample from each stratum
