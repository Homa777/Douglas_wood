Question 1
How heavy a load (in pounds) is needed to pull apart pieces of Douglas fir 4 inches long and 1.5?

A histogram is one type of a graph and they are basically used to represent the data in the graph forms. It is actually one of the best methods to represent the numerical data distribution. In histogram, the x axis represents the bin ranges and the y axis represents the information about the frequency of the data. A histogram shows the number of observations between each interval.

1 feet square =12*12*12 inch square
Density of Douglas fir= 530 KG/m3
Each meter equals to 3.2 feet
Each kg equals to 2.2 pounds                                  Density of Douglas fir= 33.1 lb/ft3
How heavy load needed to pull a part of Douglas fir wood?
Volume of the wood in inches3= 1.5*4= 6 inch3
Volume of the wood in ft3=6* 0.0005787=0.0034 ft3
Mass= 0.0034*33.1= 0.112 pound
F=Mg, that this force shows the needed loads 
We approximately consider g equal to 10  
F= 0.112 * 10= 1.12 
a)	Histogram to show the distribution of 100 loads data

To calculate the interval, we have: 
Formula	Description
n	Number of observations
Number of intervals	Square Root of n
Range	Maximum Value – Minimum Value in the dataset
Intervals width	Range / Number of intervals. 

n=100, Number of intervals=10, range=31130.77(max value) - 28668.58(min value) = 2462.19
Interval width=2462.19/10=246.219
We added this interval to min number in loads and got the following numbers as bins
28914.8
29161.02
29407.24
29653.46
29899.68
30145.89
30392.11
30638.33
30884.55
31130.77
Question 2:
Sulfur compounds cause “off odors” in wine, and winemakers want to know the odor threshold—the lowest concentration of a compound that the human nose can detect. The odor threshold for dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in trained wine tasters is about 24 micrograms per liter of wine. The untrained noses of consumers may be less sensitive.
